This contains folders for three programming assignments: 


*PA1* 

PA1 involves a C++ implementation of Prim’s algorithm that builds random minimum spanning trees given two arguments, n—the number of nodes and d—the dimension of each node (in a coordinate system). The program determines the average edge lengths for MSTs based on dimension and # of nodes.


*PA2*

PA2 is a Java program that implements a standard method and Strassen’s algorithm for matrix multiplication and determines an optimal “crossover point” to switch from traditional matrix multiplication to Strassen’s depending on matrix dimension


*PA3*

PA3 is a Java implementation of several partition algorithms (Karmarkar-Karp, Repeated Random, Pre-Partitioned Repeated Random, Hill Climbing, Pre-Partitioned Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, & Pre-Partitioned Simulated Annealing), and it determines the most optimal partition algorithm based on residual and running-time.
